# Travel-Mode-Choice-Modeling
Connected & Automated Vehicles (CAV) technology has reached the home stretch of commercialization. For the sake of making the product more economic, many people believe that rides will be combined and electrified. MCity, as a leader in CAV testing and deployment, has decided to operate the first automated shuttle line on the campus of the University of Michigan in 2017. To enhance the performance of this new mobility system and ensure its compatibility with existed facilities, we will assist the team by modeling the traveling pattern of U-M community members. The main and unique resource we will leverage on is the PrivaScope database that tracks all WiFi devices on campus. We hope to develop a data-driven algorithm for vehicle routing and scheduling use. At the end of day, it should be able to allocate automated shuttles efficiently to meet dynamic demand for traveling between campus.
